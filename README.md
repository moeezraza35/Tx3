# Tx3

Tx3 is an open-source Tic‑Tac‑Toe game by Moeez Raza. It includes multiple platform editions (console, desktop web-wrapper, and Android) and was initially developed as a semester learning project.

**About**

The name Tx3 comes from the initials of "Tic Tac Toe". The project began as a curiosity-driven exercise in clean, portable game code and educational examples.

**Editions**

- **CPP** — Command-line edition implemented in C++ (see the `CPP/` folder).
- **EEL** — Browser-wrapped desktop GUI using EEL and Python (see the `EEL/` folder).
- **Kotlin** — Android edition (see the `Kotlin/` folder).

**Quick Start**

- CPP (Windows / macOS / Linux):

	- Open a terminal in the `CPP/` folder and compile with a C++ compiler, for example:

		g++ Tic_Tac_Toe.cpp GameFunctions.cpp -o tx3

	- Run `./tx3` (or `tx3.exe` on Windows).

- EEL (Python desktop wrapper):

	- Ensure you have Python 3.8+ and the requirements installed. From the `EEL/` folder:

		pip install -r requirements.txt
		python main.py

- Kotlin (Android):

	- Open the `Kotlin/` project in Android Studio and build/run on an emulator or device.
